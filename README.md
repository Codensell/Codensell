## Hey! 👋  
I'm just starting out as a software developer, learning Go one small project at a time — mostly little games that fit where I'm at right now.  
Someday, I want to dive deep into backend work, but I'll always keep making games on the side, just for the joy of it.  
Coffee and code keep me going ☕️💻
